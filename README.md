# ðŸŒ™ Moonlight: Minecraft Server Manager

A modular, high-performance Python tool for managing Minecraft servers (Java & Bedrock).

When you first run the server, you need to accept the eula. Go to servers, server name (etc. Vannila), edit eula.txt and set eula=false to eula=true. To stop the server, you need to type stop into the console. Beacuse you can't stop the server by force. If you want to report a bug or an idea for improvent, create a issue on github.
